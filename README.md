express-mongodb
================

## Description
This is part of the series of exercises to demonstrate MERN stack.

* Server: [express-mysql](http://github.com/supershaneski/express-mysql) (mySQL version)
* Server: [express-mongodb](http://github.com/supershaneski/express-mongodb) (this repository)
* Client: [react-crud-app](http://github.com/supershaneski/react-crud-app)

This is a simple CRUD server that provides API service for a todo app.

## Important Note
This assumes that you have MongoDB installed in your local computer.

For my circumstance, I use [MongoDB Community Edition](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/) for testing. 

## Installation
Clone repository and run

```
npm install
```

## Run
Runs the app in the development mode

```
npm start
```

Point your device to [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) to access the server.
